# Drum Kit
A collaboration between Terri and Moysser, this is a drum kit webpage that plays various drum beats using the keyboard or button on the screen.

The project is from the free course by Wes Bos named JavaScript 30.  We watched the beginnning of the video to see what was being built, then built it our own way before watching the solution.
